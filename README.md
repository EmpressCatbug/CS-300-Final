# CS-300-Final
The repository here includes an analysis of runtime and memory usage of various data structures from Project One, as well as the source code for sorting and displaying Computer Science courses in alphanumeric order from Project Two.


CS 300 Project 1: Data Structure Analysis

This repository contains my analysis and implementation for Project One in the Computer Science program, focusing on data structures and their impact on runtime and memory efficiency. The project involves:

- Vector Data Structure: Implementation of a dynamic vector to manage a list of courses, including functions to load, validate, and print course information. The analysis details the operational efficiency and limitations of vectors, particularly in terms of resizing and direct access capabilities.

- Hash Table Data Structure: A robust hash table implementation to efficiently handle dynamic datasets, such as a course catalog. The repository includes pseudocode for hashing, insertion, and collision handling, with a critical evaluation of hash table performance under various conditions.

- Tree Data Structure: Implementation of a binary search tree for ordered data management and efficient searching. The document elaborates on the insertion and traversal processes, along with the complexities involved in maintaining balance in the tree.

Each section contains pseudocode, a thorough evaluation of runtime and memory considerations, and practical implications of using each data structure in real-world applications. This project showcases my ability to apply theoretical concepts to solve practical problems, highlighting my growth in understanding and implementing efficient data structures.


CS 300 Project 2: Advising Assistance Application

This repository contains the source code and data for Project 2, part of the Computer Science program, which features an Advising Assistance application designed to sort and print out a list of courses in the Computer Science program in alphanumeric order. The application is implemented in C++ and makes use of several data structures, including vectors and maps, to efficiently manage course data.

Application Overview

- AdvisingAssistance.cpp: This is the main C++ source file that contains the implementation of the course management system. It includes functionalities such as reading course data from a text file, storing it in appropriate data structures, and providing various utilities to interact with this data effectively.
- Courses.txt: Contains the list of courses along with their prerequisites formatted as CSV. This file serves as the input for populating the course data within the application.

Features

- Course Listing: Sorts and displays all courses in the Computer Science program in alphanumeric order based on course numbers.
- Prerequisite Checking: Allows checking and displaying prerequisites for each course, ensuring that course dependencies are met.
- Efficient Data Handling: Uses maps and vectors to manage course data efficiently, facilitating quick lookups and modifications.

Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the C++ source using an appropriate compiler that supports the C++ Standard.
3. Run the compiled application and follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the course data.

Objective

This project demonstrates the application of data structures in developing a practical tool that can assist students and advisors in managing course prerequisites and planning academic schedules effectively. It showcases my understanding of software development and algorithm implementation in C++.
