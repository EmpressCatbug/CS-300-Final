# CS-300-Final
The repository here includes an analysis of runtime and memory usage of various data structures from Project One, as well as the source code for sorting and displaying Computer Science courses in alphanumeric order from Project Two.


CS 300 Project 1: Data Structure Analysis

This repository contains my analysis and implementation for Project One in the Computer Science program, focusing on data structures and their impact on runtime and memory efficiency. The project involves:

- Vector Data Structure: Implementation of a dynamic vector to manage a list of courses, including functions to load, validate, and print course information. The analysis details the operational efficiency and limitations of vectors, particularly in terms of resizing and direct access capabilities.

- Hash Table Data Structure: A robust hash table implementation to efficiently handle dynamic datasets, such as a course catalog. The repository includes pseudocode for hashing, insertion, and collision handling, with a critical evaluation of hash table performance under various conditions.

- Tree Data Structure: Implementation of a binary search tree for ordered data management and efficient searching. The document elaborates on the insertion and traversal processes, along with the complexities involved in maintaining balance in the tree.

Each section contains pseudocode, a thorough evaluation of runtime and memory considerations, and practical implications of using each data structure in real-world applications. This project showcases my ability to apply theoretical concepts to solve practical problems, highlighting my growth in understanding and implementing efficient data structures.
